# Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate the usage of the Vue.js DApp with Ethereum integration:

## Sending Messages

1. **Send a Message**:
   - Open the DApp in your web browser.
   - Connect MetaMask to your Ethereum account.
   - Use the message input field (`MessageInput.vue`) to type a message and click 'Send'.
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask to send the message to the blockchain.

2. **View Messages**:
   - Messages sent are displayed in the chat box (`ChatBox.vue`).
   - Fetch and display messages stored on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.

## Smart Contract Interaction

1. **Deploy Smart Contract**:
   - Compile the `ChatBot.sol` contract and deploy it to your preferred Ethereum network.
   - Update the contract address in `web3.js` for interaction within the DApp.

2. **Interact with Smart Contract**:
   - Use Web3.js to call smart contract functions such as sending messages, fetching messages, etc.
   - Ensure proper gas fees and transaction management through MetaMask or another provider.

These examples illustrate basic functionalities of the DApp and showcase its integration with Ethereum blockchain for messaging and smart contract interaction.
